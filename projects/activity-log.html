            <h2>The story behind its appearance</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Did I tell you I'm currently working in the data field? Huh? Well...this information is quite important to understand how the idea was born.
                    As stated in my <a href="#">About me</a> page — I hope you have already read it...right? — I'm an apprentice in a banking company.
                    One of my missions is to produce and publish <strong>BI reports</strong> for other entities, based on data from different types of sources, such as extraction files, database queries, REST APIs and so on.
                    We are using <strong>Microsoft Power BI</strong> as the main tool.</p>
                <p>Since I'm working in a team of Data Scientist and Engineers, we are also using Power BI to track and compute the time spent on the subjects we are working on.</p>

                <p>We use an Excel file to store all the information related to those subjects. However it becomes more and more tiring to manually estimate the average time on specific and repetitive tasks,
                    as we have to update the file each time.
                    At some point, I told myself: <span class="quote">Everything could be simpler if there was a piece of software that could resolve this issue</span> —
                    and make coffee, but we all know the answer to this request unfortunately...</p>
                <p>As I'm used to version my college and personal projects with <strong>Git</strong> — like 99.999999...% of software developers — I thought this system as one of the best when it is
                    about keeping track on stuff that has long lives in their usage and welcomes well collaboration and nice self-documented project progress —
                    with commit messages, tags, merges, issues,...
                </p>
                <p>At some point, I thought it would be interessing to pick some of the basic concepts of Git and bring them into any software that needs it. That is how <strong>Activity Log</strong> was thought out in the process:
                    tracking topics/subjects/projects and breaking them down into tasks completed as you go along.
                    <span class="quote">
                        Need to switch to another subject? No problem! Hit the X command.
                        Need to register a new subject? Hit the Y command.
                        Want to see all the tasks you have done today? Hit that Z command. See? You are productive today! Keep going!
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>When I was sure building something new would solve a 'real-life' issue — and not some too specific or imaginary problem —
                    I jumped right in this occasion to start a new personal project — among the other hundreds of dead projects that keep calling me in dreams, or nigthmares...</p>
                <p>Now let's see how the tool was built. Spoiler: it was not as smooth as I thought it would be. Would not be interesting if everything was easy
                    from the get-go, dont't you agree?
